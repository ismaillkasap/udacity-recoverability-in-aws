# Udacity Project - Recoverability In AWS
The project is one of the projects in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

In this project I have created highly available solutions to common use cases. I have:

- Built a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and showed how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.  
- Built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
